The sync function now works in 3 steps:

1. Scan MP3 folder - create new songs from MP3 filenames that don't exist yet
   - Parses "Artist - Title.mp3" format
   - Creates song with audio_path already linked
   
2. Link MP3s to existing songs without audio
   - Matches by title/artist in filename
   
3. Link sheets to songs without charts
   - Prioritizes: "chords" > "chart" > any match

Removed songlist folder logic (no longer needed since songs are created from MP3s directly)
